# Effective meetings and group work

To increase flexibility in how and where employees at Tidepool work, we agree on a shared set of constraints for group work and meetings. 

## Meeting Etiquette

### Meetings start on time

If you're leading a meeting, it's your responsibility to start the meeting on time. If you're attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time.

### Meetings happen in regular hours

All team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:30am-1:00p Pacific Time, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. If a meeting needs to happen outside of these hours, the meeting organizer should scheduled it a week in advance. 

### Meetings should generally have a video option

Tidepool is a highly distributed team. Most of our meeting happen online, often using Zoom. If you're hosting a meeting, please schedule it within Google Calendar and make sure it includes a video meeting link. 

If you're attending a meeting remotely, please join the video call at or before the start time. It's your responsibility to ensure this is possible â€” this means being in a quiet place with a fast internet connection before the meeting starts. Calling into a meeting via phone or from a public place can be done occasionally if required, but please try to avoid it.

### Prerequisites for successful meetings

The following things are pre-requisites for successful group work:

* A fast, reliable internet connection. Remote employees should make all efforts to mitigate video call lag.
* A quiet place to take meetings.
