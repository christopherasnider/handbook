# Healthcare, Disability Insurance and other benefits.

The following applies to full-time U.S.-based employees.

Tidepool's priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so itâ€™s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and disability insurance. Because of our mission, many of our employees have a personal connection to a chronic illness. Therefore, we strive to provide a full-featured health plan that mimimizes deductables and out-of-pocket expenses and avoids lifetime caps.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at Tidepool for full-time U.S.-based employees and their dependents. All full-time US employees receive Short Term Disability Insurance and Long Term Disability Insurance.

Our current medical plan is provided through Blue Shield of California:
* Plan name: Platinum Full PPO 0/10 OffEx
* Calendar Year Medical Deductible: $0
* Calendar Year Out of Pocket Maximum:
    * Participating providers: $2,500 per individual / $5,000 per family
    * Non-participating providers: $5,000 per individual / $10,000 per family
* Lifetime Benefit Maximum: None

Employees are also eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Tidepool will match contributions to the FSA dollor-for-dollar up to $2700. Employees can also take advantage of a dependent and elder care FSA account that provides up to $5000 in funds at no cost to the employee.

Employees may contribute to a 401(k) retirement savings plan. Tidepool does not currently offer contribution matching.
