# Vacation and Sick Leave Non-Policy

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at Tidepool, so in addition to the U.S. [Holiday List](https://github.com/tidepool-org/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), Tidepool wants you to take whatever vacation time and sick leave you need in order to maintain a healthy and balanced life while still fulfilling your responsibilities at Tidepool. Vacation time and sick leave do not accrue at Tidepool.

People often ask "Well, in general about how much vacation time do people take?" Historically, the answer has been "about three weeks per year," though sometimes more and sometimes less. We sometimes try to coordinate our time off; for example, most people take off the week between Christmas and New Year's Day (though some people still need to work, such as to provide ops coverage or customer support).

Tidepool does not accrue "sick days." If you are sick and unable to work, take the time you need to become healthy. If you think it will become an extended absence, please talk to the CEO or VP of HR about it.

Due to the nature of our business and mission, many of our employees are living with or have a family member living with a chronic disease. We understand that sometimes you may need to take time off in order to take care of yourself or a family member.

So in short, our vacation and sick leave policy is: We have no policy. We trust you. Take what time you need to lead a balanced and healthy life, so that when you are working you are productive, energetic and inspiring others on the team to do the same.
