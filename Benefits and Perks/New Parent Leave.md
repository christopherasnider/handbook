# Parental Leave

Tidepool offers 6 weeks of paid leave for all full time employees, regardless of gender or sexual identity, after the birth or adoption of a child. This time is for the new parent to welcome and bond with the newborn or newly adopted child or children into their home and family. The leave should be taken within a year after the birth or adoption of the child. Leave can either be taken all at once or split over a 12-month period.

Employees should give the rest of the team as much notice as possible before they take new parent leave, though there is no requirement for how far in advance notification needs to be given. Parenthood can be unexpected and sensitive, but the more that a team can anticipate the absence, the easier it will be to handle.

Paid time off of any kind, including New Parent Leave, does not accrue.

In California, State Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave programs will pay part of an employee's salary who are unable to work due to pregnancy and childbirth. It is illegal for an employer to overpay an employee while they are using those programs, so Tidepool will supplement them to maintain the employee's salary instead of paying the full salary on top of them.

Other local jurisdictions may have additional requirements for parental leave. Your local jurisdiction laws always apply.
