# Working with Tidepool

There are several categories of people who may work with or interact with Tidepool. In general, the policies in this Tidepool Employee Handbook apply to everyone except "Volunteers and Other Contributors". Exceptions to this, such as Benefits for Full-time U.S. employees, are noted where appropriate.

Here is a brief description of the different kinds of people who work with Tidepool:

## Full-time U.S.-based Employees

Full-time U.S.-based employees work 30 or more hours per week. Offer letters are administered through [Zenefits](https://zenefits.com), our online HR system.

Full-time U.S.-based employees are eligible for benefits such as health insurance and 401(k). See "Benefits and Perks" for more details.

## Part-time U.S.-based Employees

Part-time U.S.-based employees work fewer than 30 hours per week, and are not eligible for benefits such as health insurance and 401(k). Offer letters are administered through Zenefits.

## Full-time International Contractors (FTICs, for short)

Tidepool is a highly distributed team. For example, we currently employ full-time international contractors in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Employment contracts with FTICs are administered individually with each contractor. FTICs do not use Zenefits.

Although FTICs do not receive U.S.-based benefits such as health insurance and 401(k), we think of and treat FTICs the same way we think of and treat full-time U.S.-based employees in all other regards.

## Part-time Contractors

Tidepool occasionally hires Part-time Contractors to help with specific assignments.

Part-time contractors typically do not get an @tidepool.org email address or access Tidepool internal systems like Google Drive.

## Consultants, Contract Development Firms and other Agencies

Tidepool hires specialty consultants and firms to help with work in areas where we do not have in-house expertise.

For example, Tidepool currently works with:
* [DuffLite](http://dufflite.com) - our mobile development partner
* [Early Growth Financial Services](http://earlygrowthfinancialservices.com/) - Sirk Roh (CFO) and Tina Gregory (accountant)

Contracts are administered individually with these Consultants. 

## Interns

Tidepool occasionally hires interns, typically during the summer in the U.S., though potentially at other times as well.

Interns receive their offer letters through Zenefits, and are paid hourly.

## Volunteers and Other Contributors, including Open Source Contributors

Tidepool often engages with volunteers, most typically with software developers as Open Source contributors, but sometimes also with volunteer program managers, user experience designers or beta testers.

Volunteers who are producing and contributing source code or user interface designs will be asked to complete Tidepool's [Volunteer Contributor License Agreement (VCLA)](http://developer.tidepool.org/contributors/).

## Pro-bono arrangements

* [Wilson, Marshall and Taylor](http://wmtlaw.com/) - legal services, Kurt Taylor, General Counsel and Board Secretary
